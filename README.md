- Average temperatures were around 4 degrees warmer in June
- June also had a lower standard deviation (3.26 vs 3.75)
- The min of December was 8 degrees lowers than the min of June

## Analysis 

Looking at the results, June predictably was warmer, however, to a smaller degree than what one may anticipate. The lower standard deviation, quartiles and mins and maxes in June support the idea that temperature variations in said month are smaller vs December. One other query that could be beneficial would look into trends over time. It is possible the weather is varying as years pass. We could also look into precipitation to get an idea of how many rainy days each month gets
